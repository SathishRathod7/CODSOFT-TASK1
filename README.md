Overview of the Project

Project: Titanic Survival Prediction

Objective:        
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model using the Titanic dataset to determine whether a passenger survived the tragic event based on various features such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and other relevant attributes

Key Activities:         
  1.Dataset Selection: Choose a dataset relevant to the problem domain or area of interest.    
  2. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values through imputation or removal,Correct data types if necessary,Remove duplicates and irrelevant data         
  3. Feature Engineering:Create new features that may improve the model's performance, such as family size, title extraction from the name, or grouping ages into bins.       
  4. Data Transformation: Feature scaling and normalization,Encode categorical variables if necessary,Create new features from existing ones if applicable    
  5. Data Visualization: Visualize findings with histograms, scatter plots, pair plots, and heatmaps using matplotlib and seaborn.     

Technologies Used:         
 1.Python: Programming Language     
 2.pandas: for data manipulation and analysis.     
 3. numpy: for numerical operations and array handling.     
 4. matplotlib: for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.    
 5. seaborn: for statistical data visualization.
